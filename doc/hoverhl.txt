INTRODUCTION AND FEATURES                                    *hoverhl-intro*

Hover highlight (hoverhl) is a vim plugin that automatically highlights the
word under your cursor and lets you navigate though other instances of the
highlighted word. After installing the plugin, whenever you stop moving the
cursor for `&updatetime` milliseconds, the word underneath the cursor will be
highlighted throughout the document.

You can then navigate to other instances of the word by using `<leader>n` and
`<leader>N` as you would normally use `n` and `N` on a search. You can also lock
the hovered word with `<leader>//` to keep it as the current highlight until
it is unlocked via `<leader>//` again. You can toggle the plugin on the fly by
using `<leader>/t`. Alternatively, use `<leader>/e` to enable the plugin, and
`<leader>/d` to disable the plugin.

COMMANDS                                                  *hoverhl-commands*

HoverHlToggle()    " Enables/disables the plugin
HoverHlEnable()    " Enables the plugin
HoverHlDisable()   " Disables the plugin
HoverHlLock()      " Locks/unlocks the highlighted word
HoverHlForward(n)  " Moves to the nth next instance of the highlighted word
HoverHlBackward(n) " Moves to the nth previous instance of the highlighted word

These functions are also available in `command` and `map <plug>` forms.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *hoverhl-configuration*

By default, this plugin is enabled for all filetypes. You can set a list of
filetypes to have it only highlight in those files by setting
`g:hoverhl#enabled_filetypes` to the desired types: >
  let g:hoverhl#enabled_filetypes = [ 'c', 'cpp', 'js', 'sh', 'vim', '...' ]
<If you would like to remove the default bindings entirely, you can set
`g:hoverhl#standard_mappings` to 0. You will have to then create your own
bindings, or call the commands yourself!

The plugin uses the current colorscheme's `CursorLine` highlight colors by
default. If you'd prefer colors from a different highlight group, or
different colors altogether, you can set the following in your vimrc: >
  let g:hoverhl#match_group = 'Search'
<Or, if you'd prefer custom colors entirely: >
  " UI-agnostic: Colorname
  let g:hoverhl#custom_fg = 'LightBlue'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_bg = 'LightBlue'
  " GUI: Colorname, #RRGGBB
  let g:hoverhl#custom_guifg = 'LightBlue'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_guibg = '#ADD8E6'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_guisp = '#0088FF'
  " CTERM: Colorname, Colorindex
  let g:hoverhl#custom_ctermfg = 'LightBlue'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_ctermbg = 9
<Alternatively, to leave the fore/background color untouched when hovering: >
  let g:hoverhl#custom_fg = ''
<Finally, you can customize the decorations via comma-separated strings: >
  let g:hoverhl#custom_dc = 'underline'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_guidc = 'bold,italics'
  let g:hoverhl#custom_guidc = ''
<NOTE: If these are set, they take precedence over the highlight group!

If you would like to disable automatic loading, you can set
`g:hoverhl#enabled_default` to 0.

If you want to only show highlights in the current buffer, you can set
`g:hoverhl#clear_on_leave` to 1.

If you want case sensitivity that doesn't follow smartcase/ignorecase, set
`g:hoverhl#case_sensitive` to 0 or 1.
